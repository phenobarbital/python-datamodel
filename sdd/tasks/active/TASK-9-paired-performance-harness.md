# TASK-9: Add reproducible paired model performance measurements

**Feature**: FEAT-2 - Compatible model execution performance
**Spec**: `sdd/specs/compatible-model-performance.spec.md`
**Status**: pending
**Priority**: high
**Estimated effort**: M (3h active engineering time; external evidence wait excluded)
**Depends-on**: TASK-8
**Parallel**: true
**Parallelism notes**: Can run alongside asyncdb corpus preparation; own benchmark runner files. Actual timing jobs run alone.
**Assigned-to**: unassigned

---

## Context

Implements M1 of the approved specification; contributes to AC1, AC5, AC6, AC11. Constructor/ORM hydration performance is the priority, with strict compatibility for repository schema examples and real `asyncdb.models`. Rust, parallel execution and serialization are measured experiments, not automatic backend migrations.

Approval is recorded in spec frontmatter and resolved requirements in §8. Its older body status/release placeholders do not override those decisions.

## Scope

- Implement the spec protocol: at least 7 paired fresh processes, 1000 warm-up operations and at least 30 batches of 2000 constructions, alternating backend order.
- Time raw/native Employee, primitive/constrained/nested/custom/invalid/50-field cases, class creation, assignment, JSON and to_dict; keep fixture preparation out of constructor-only timing.
- Report process-paired ratios and 95% uncertainty, median and explicitly defined upper-tail batch metric (p95), peak allocation diagnostics and retained memory separately.
- Record all environment/build/runtime flags and raw samples in machine-readable output; timing runs must disable profiling counters.
- Provide a short smoke mode for harness tests that is labelled non-acceptance.

**NOT in scope**: Production optimizations or runtime tracing switches.

## Files to Create / Modify

Ownership is restricted to these implementation/test/report files, plus this task's completion note and per-spec index state. Expand scope only through an explicit task/spec update.

| File | Action | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `benchmarks/model_performance.py` | CREATE | Development-only measurement harness |
| `tests/compatibility/test_benchmark_protocol.py` | CREATE | Compatibility fixtures, test support or regression tests |
| `benchmarks/results/compatible-model-performance/baseline.json` | CREATE | Reproducible evidence and decision report |

## Codebase Contract (Anti-Hallucination)

References were re-read against the current `dev` tree after FEAT-001 integration and before task creation (runtime baseline `1d578ab`; reservation `4d5f97d`). Verify freshness again before implementation. Planned dependency outputs are not yet existing contracts.

### Verified Imports

```python
from datamodel import BaseModel, Field, Column
from datamodel.exceptions import ValidationError
```

### Existing Signatures to Use

- examples/rust_benchmark.py:35-51 — Employee's 11 fields, required/primary metadata and age bounds; PAYLOAD/NATIVE_PAYLOAD at 105-139.
- examples/test_qsmodel.py:38-68 — QueryModel schema with optional nested containers and defaults.
- examples/test_datadriver.py:8-45 — DataDriver with InitVar and custom __post_init__ calling super; inspect before executing examples with top-level code.
- tests/test_qsmodel.py:12-82 — existing QueryModel fixture pattern; tests/test_converter.py:6-61 — Organization/Client nested ORM-like models.
- datamodel/base.py:35-55 — errors/state observable at construction.
- datamodel/models.py:134-152,209-226,304-308 — reset_values/old_value, to_dict and json.
- datamodel/abstract.py:66-145 — assignment history and parser-only assignment validation.
- tests/test_descriptors.py:6-80 — descriptors execute through normal attribute access; tests/test_field.py:8-70 — fields/defaults/metadata.
- setup.py:15-29,98-106 — _compiler_flags() selects /O2 on Windows and -O3 on POSIX; guarded setup invocation and existing Cython extensions.
- pyproject.toml:1-8,19,57-74 — Cython>=3.2.8, Python>=3.10, optional uvloop and dev dependencies after FEAT-001.
- scripts/stage_rust_ext.py:30-59 — build_wheel(manifest: str, out_dir: str, interpreter: str, manylinux: str | None, maturin_bin: str = 'maturin') -> int; builds rs_parsers through maturin, not the experimental rs_core loader.
- .github/workflows/release.yml:13-25,49-65 — Ubuntu/Windows × CPython3.10–3.14, Linux x86_64/Windows AMD64, skips musllinux; current wheel test only asserts HAS_RUST.
- datamodel/version.py:9 — current version is already 0.11.0; do not bump it again.

### Does NOT Exist

- Files marked CREATE below are planned artifacts, not existing interfaces. Read completed dependencies to verify their newly introduced APIs before using them.
- No existing production per-field validation policy, compatible rs_core backend loader, or public batch-construction API is established by this contract.
- `_validate_constraints` is a Cython cdef interface, not a Python-importable function. Do not invent Python imports for it.

## Implementation Notes

### Pattern to Follow

Use standard-library statistics or existing development dependencies; no new runtime dependency. All future performance comparisons must use this same protocol.

Use the existing paths and behavior described in the contract, not the illustrative placeholders in the generic task template. Read §2–§5 of the specification for dispatch semantics, measurement protocol and acceptance thresholds.

### Key Constraints

- Preserve reference behavior, including legacy quirks; do not migrate consumers to Pydantic, weaken checks, change public/cpdef return contracts, or require model rebuild calls.
- Reference: d932c720e9e36bbacdaca2b1a2af0688f2636c40 (0.10.21), rebuilt in isolation. Candidate targets 0.11.0 and preserves FEAT-001 Linux/Windows × CPython 3.10–3.14 support.
- Use deterministic offline inputs. No production database writes, release publication, new backend packaging, or service credentials are authorized by this task.
- Rebuild affected Cython/Rust artifacts before testing. Separate diagnostic instrumentation from release timings; benchmark runs and shared extension builds require exclusive execution.
- Do not count missing dependencies, platforms, failed builds or unfinished measurements as successful verification or a completed negative experiment.
- Work in the per-spec feature worktree. You are not alone in the codebase: preserve others' edits and coordinate shared files rather than reverting their work.

### References in Codebase

The verified contract above is the source for existing behavior. New interfaces from `TASK-8` must be documented with their actual definitions, never inferred from proposed filenames.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Normal acceptance configuration meets all minimum sample counts; smoke reports cannot be mistaken for release measurements.
- [ ] The runner produces raw samples, per-process ratios and reproducible summary metrics for both artifact paths.
- [ ] Fresh artifact provenance is validated before timings; Pydantic remains an optional contextual comparison.
- [ ] No per-constructor timer overhead or concurrent workload is included accidentally in acceptance runs.
- [ ] Required tests and evidence are recorded with actual commands/results; no new reference-relative regression is hidden.
- [ ] Only scoped files and task/index state change; AC1, AC5, AC6, AC11 evidence is linked in the completion note.

## Test Specification

- Run `python -m pytest tests/compatibility/test_benchmark_protocol.py -q`.
- Run the implemented CLI in smoke mode for identical reference/candidate artifacts and check schema/provenance, not noisy speed thresholds.
- Capture a real baseline with the full protocol once build artifacts are available.

Tests are behavioral specifications, not permission to change the oracle. Verify import paths of new test-support modules after their dependency tasks land. A quick smoke run is not a substitute for the full acceptance protocol.

## Agent Instructions

1. Read the full spec and this task before acting; use `sdd/tasks/index/compatible-model-performance.json`, never the historical monolithic index.
2. Confirm dependencies are done/verified in that index and their task files are in `sdd/tasks/completed/`. Read their completion notes and newly implemented contracts.
3. Verify every relevant contract with `rg` and source reads before writing code. Record changed/new definitions first; do not guess imports or attributes.
4. Update only this task's assignment, start timestamp and status to `in-progress` in the per-spec index.
5. Implement only the declared scope, preserving other contributors' work. Respect the parallelism notes and serialize shared build/timing resources.
6. Run the scoped tests plus appropriate rebuilt-artifact differential checks. Record commands, artifact identities and raw evidence. If a prerequisite or required gate fails, keep the task incomplete and report it; do not waive it.
7. Fill the completion note, then use `scripts/sdd/close_task.sh TASK-9 compatible-model-performance verified` only when all required criteria are met. Verify the active copy is gone and the per-spec index points to the completed file.
8. Commit the scoped changes and task/index state in the feature worktree following the task-execution skill. Do not publish or merge the feature as part of this task.
